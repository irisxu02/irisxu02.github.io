    <div class="pad-4 flex-space">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="assets/ccmap.html" title="Travel Map" frameborder="0";></iframe>    
    </div>
    <p class="pad-4">Using Python and libraries like Folium, I generated a map to mark the places I've travelled to. The script reads from a list of locations from a Google Sheets spreadsheet.</p>

    <h3 class="pad-4">Virtual Reality Volleyball Game</h3>
    <div class="pad-4 flex-space">
    <img src="assets/images/vr-vball.gif" width="80%" alt="hitting a volleyball over the net in VR">
    </div>
    <p class="pad-4">This is a fun VR project I built with a classmate at ETH. The code and build is <a href="https://github.com/irisxu02/vr-volleyball" class="accenttext2">here</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="pad-4">CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python</h3>
    <div class="pad-4 flex-space">
    <img src="assets/images/tictactoe.gif" width="47%" alt="animation of a tic-tac-toe game against a computer">
    <img src="assets/images/minesweeper.png" width="47%" alt="minesweeper pygame on 8x8 grid">
    </div>
    <p class="pad-4">Various projects (on top of lectures and quizzes) for each week, focused on learning
    topics such as search, optimization, natural language processing, etc. Experience is
    gained in working with libraries for machine learning and experimenting with the intelligent systems
    designed for the course. Animation above shows an intelligent agent - the computer - play the
    simple game of tic-tac-toe. The minesweeper game above has an option for the AI to make a move,
    which the program chooses a spot to clear based on probability. (I hit the mine)</p>

    <img src="assets/images/prune_demo.PNG" class="pad-4" width="80%"
        alt="three images with blocky effect with block sizes increasing left to right">
    <p class="pad-4">Inspired by Dimitris
    Ladopoulos in <a
            href="https://mymodernmet.com/algorithm-art-color-study-dimitris-ladopoulos/"
            class="accenttext2">this article</a> in creating a blocky artistic effect on images using strategy
    underlying common lossy image compression algorithms. The original image is recursively split into
    rectangles based on hue variability and represented in memory as a tree, which is pruned based on
    average hue of subtrees. The pictures above are created with different tolerances for pruning.</p>

    <img src="assets/images/chrome_ext_screenshot.png" class="pad-4" width="80%" alt="screenshot of web browser with chrome extension opened on top right">
    <p class="pad-4">This is a browser extension that helps users check the price of similar products by keeping
    track of prices of products when online shopping. The goal is to make price comparisons quicker with
    automatic sorting. This was built with 3 other friends in 24h in a hackathon.</p>

        alt="screenshot of app displaying a table and bar plot">
    <p class="pad-4">A web app with a dynamic ui and reactive elements that make exploring and visualizing
    tennis player data easier. Custom filters and options can be applied to see more specific data or even
    to compare player statistics. Behind the scenes, data is collected from official sources, cleaned and
    organized using both R and Python scripts, before being used in this app.</p>
