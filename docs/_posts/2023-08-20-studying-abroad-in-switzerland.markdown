I had the incredible opportunity of a lifetime to spend six months studying abroad at one of the top universities in the world, ETH Zurich. Back in February, I had packed my bags and travelled alone over 8300km to a new city in a new country on an unfamiliar continent. I remember the feeling of excitement and nervousness like it all happened just yesterday. And more recently, the bittersweet feeling of leaving that place I fell in love with.

## Struggles
In a nutshell, my experience was great, then not so good, then AMAZING. The first weeks were fun and I had time to explore. I let myself get settled and figure out an entire list of administrative and very necessary *adulting* tasks.

## New Friendships
Perhaps the coolest part is that now I feel so much more connected to the rest of the world through my new friendships. 

## Swiss Culture
I lived the Swiss way of life. I paid extra attention to being timely. With multiple clocks at every street corner, there was constant reminder at how important time was. Sundays were noticeably quiet in the city. It is a day of rest, meaning that taking out the recycling was not allowed and it was not a day for getting groceries or completing other house chores.

## Travelling
My camera was a trusty, constant companion as I aimed to capture much of the beautiful scenery and atmosphere around me. It's a Sony RX100 VII compact for any camera geeks out there. I nurtured my growing passion for photography and found myself spending lots of time learning about

## Gratitude
I am beyond grateful to everyone who supported me. To mom and dad, thanks for 

As I close this chapter and return home to finish my final year of school, I carry with me a renewed purpose and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. My semester at ETH Zurich has left an indelible mark on my heart and mind, reminding me that embracing new experiences is a gateway to endless growth.

Here's to the adventures that shape us and the memories that stay with us forever! <3

Until next time,
